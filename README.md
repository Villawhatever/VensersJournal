# VensersJournal
A comprehensive diff portal for Magic: the Gathering tournament docs.

# What We Got
All the magic (THAT'S A PUN) happens in the difftool folder. Python scripts rip the Comprehensive Rules apart and spit them out in an easy-to-digest, side by side diff. The only reason this process isn't entirely automated at this point is because there isn't actually a good way to get the most recent set that Wizards has released. If someone has a reasonable approach to this, I'm all ears.

For the time being, Infraction Procedure Guide and Magic Tournament Rules diffs are done by hand. This is largely because they're done in-line, not side by side like the CR. That, coupled with the absolute nightmare that is extracting text from a PDF into a sane, parseable format, has put automating this on the backburner for the time being. It's being worked on when I have the inclination, mostly.

The archives aren't totally complete yet, but I'm working on it. We have a *massive* chunk of the previous rules docs, and the IPG and MTR are complete-ish for the last few years. There are also some weird, far distant outliers in the mix.
