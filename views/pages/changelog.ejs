        <h3>13 June, 2019</h3>
        <p><b>6:20am CST</b> - Another set, another minor editorial bug I had to hunt down! Without delving into too much detail, basically 612.8 has something I've never had to account for before, but now
        I'm accounting for it, so it's showing up like it should be. Yay!</p>
        <h3>12 June, 2019</h3>
        <p><b>11:03pm CST</b> - Modern Horizons rules are... mostly up? There's some cute little bug somewhere that isn't letting me pick up the new 612.8, but it's a trivial rule that's also covered in more
        detail elsewhere, so this isn't something a sane person should care about; as far as you, sane person, are concerned, this does exactly what it's supposed to do! Now excuse me as I go agonize over
        what on earth is happening.</p>
      	<h3>4 May, 2019</h3>
      	<p><b>1:15am CST</b> - Fixed the issue with the single quotes (which, uh, you can't see now, since it's fixed). Also fixed the trailing space highlighting, which was driving at least two people crazy.
      	I changed another thing that only affected the parsing of three rules (for now). While they haven't been relevant <i>yet</i>, I'd rather cover the potential cases now instead of when it'd actually be 
      	a matter of concern.</p>        
        <h3>3 May, 2019</h3>
        <p><b>12:00pm CST</b> - New CR! Yay! The editorial weirdness from RNA is 'fixed', and I've rewritten some of the parsing code to handle most of those snafus. Still having
        an issue figuring out what's up with the single quotes (you'll see what I mean, look at 603.4 for an example).</p>
        <p>In news that won't matter for most of you, the new CR is, in fact, served in glorious UTF-8, so we have to do significantly less very silly nonsense to parse it properly now. Rejoice!</p>
        <h3>29 April, 2019</h3>
        <p><b>3:30pm CST</b> - IPG and MTR diffs for 3 May 2019 (War of the Spark) are complete. The raw docs are uploaded to the archive. Still waiting on the Comp Rules,
        but hopefully those will be in-hand today.</p>
        <p>Also, as you may or may not have noticed (you probably have, since you're here) -- added a change log.</p>
