        <p>This site is maintained by <b>Andrew Villarrubia</b>, an L2 Judge from US-South. The CR diffs used to be <a href='https://yawgatog.com/'>Yawgatog's</a> project, 
            but they stopped with Ixalan; I'm picking it up with their blessing.

        <p>If you find a bug, I would <b>strongly</b> prefer you open an issue on <a href='https://github.com/Villawhatever/VensersJournal/issues'>Github</a>.</p>

        <p>Otherwise -- for suggestions, more general feedback, etc -- reach out on Twitter <a href='https://twitter.com/villawhatever'>@villawhatever</a>, IRC (Volo on EFNet and freenode), or e-mail me through JudgeApps.</p>

        <p>Special thanks to <b>Jorge Requesens</b> for providing a massive chunk of the archived tournament docs and <b>Arttu Kaipiainen</b> for helping me track down bugs.
