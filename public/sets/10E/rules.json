An effect puts a +1/+1 counter on it (layer 6c), making it 3/3. An effect that says \"Target creature gets +4/+4 until end of turn\" is applied to it (layer 6b), making it 7/7. An enchantment that says \"Creatures you control get +0/+2\" enters play (layer 6d), making it a 7/9. An effect that says \"Target creature becomes 0/1 until end of turn\" is applied to it (layer 6b), making it a 1/4 (0/1, plus +1/+1 from the counter, plus +0/+2 from the enchantment)."

The copy has the same mode that was chosen for the original Emerald Charm.
