If an effect then turns the creature white, it gets +1/+1 from Crusade, becoming 3/3. If the creature's color is later changed to red, Crusade's effect stops applying to it, and it will return to being a 2/2.\nExample: Gray Ogre, a 2/2 creature, is in play. An effect puts a +1/+1 counter on it, making it 3/3. An effect that says \"Target creature gets +4/+4 until end of turn\" is applied to it, making it 7/7. An enchantment that says \"Creatures you control get +0/+2\" enters play, making it a 7/9. An effect that says \"Target creature becomes 0/1 until end of turn\" is applied to it, making it a 1/4 (0/1, plus +1/+1 from the counter, plus +0/+2 from the enchantment).\nExample: Svogthos, the Restless Tomb, is in play. An effect that says \"Until end of turn, target land becomes a 3/3 creature that's still a land\" is applied to it. An effect that says \"Target creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn\" is applied to it, making it a 4/4 land creature. Then you activate Svogthos's ability (\"Until end of turn, Svogthos, the Restless Tomb becomes a black and green Plant Zombie creature with 'This creature's power and toughness are each equal to the number of creature cards in your graveyard.' It's still a land.\") while you have ten creature cards in your graveyard. It becomes a 10/10 land creature. If a creature card enters or leaves your graveyard, Svogthos's power and toughness will be modified accordingly. If the first effect is applied to it again, it will become a 3/3 land creature again."
